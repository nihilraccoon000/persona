                <p style="color:darkgrey">A sketch of a typical BoA ATM for drawing and depositing cash. Users use the number pad to insert passwords or cash amount, insert/take their cards/cash from the corresponding outlets, and use the touch screen to interact with most of the instructions. Today's BoA ATMs also come with a tap zone for contactless transaction.</p>

            <!-- Description  -->
            <div class="col-12 col-xxl-6 px-3 px-sm-5 ml-md-auto pb-3 pb-sm-5">
                <p class="lead">My observations: <br>
                    Most users are either students or staff. 
                    Most interactions with the ATM went smooth. <br>
                    People processed at slightly different paces. 
                    Some got their goal completed very quickly, some would gaze at the screen for a bit longer. <br>
                    The common process most people follow without looking at any instructions: Insert card -- Input password -- Interact with screen
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="lead">I asked the ATM users about the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li class="lead">Are you here for depositing or drawing or anything else? Have you encountered any problems?</li>
                        <li class="lead">Do you find the process straightforward?</li>
                        <li class="lead" style="color:darkgrey">
                            (A not-so-relevant bonus question that I asked some people out of curiosity:) <br>
                            Have you noticed the tap zone? 
                            Are you using/will you be using NFC instead of a physical card?
                            Do you find it more convenient/Do you think it'd be more convenient?
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Summarizing the answers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="lead">Most people use the ATM mainly to draw cash, and the process is straightforward for people.</li>
                    <li class="lead">The process is straightforward for people</li>
                    <li class="lead" style="color:darkgrey">
                        (Addressing the bonus question above) <br>
                        People who are using NFC find it convenient. <br>
                        People who are not using NFC can hardly notice the tap zone, and they tend to not use it because they think using a physical card is not that inconvenient; some also express security concerns.
